## Everyday Scenarios

### Splitting a Dinner Bill

**The situation:** You're out with friends and someone paid the full bill. Now everyone needs to chip in.

**With BuhoGO:**
1. Your friend shares their Lightning address (like `alice@wallet.com`)
2. Open BuhoGO and tap "Send"
3. Type their address or scan their QR code
4. Enter your share amount
5. Hit send — done in seconds

**Why it works:** No bank apps, no waiting for transfers, no exchange rates if you're traveling. Just instant settlement.


### Paying a Street Vendor

**The situation:** You're at a farmers market or street fair. The vendor has a Bitcoin payment sign.

**With BuhoGO:**
1. Ask the vendor for their payment QR code
2. Open BuhoGO and tap "Send"
3. Point your camera at the QR code
4. Confirm the amount and send

**Why it works:** Works anywhere with internet. No card readers needed, no minimum purchase amounts.


### Receiving Money from Family Abroad

**The situation:** Your cousin in another country wants to send you money for your birthday.

**With BuhoGO:**
1. Open BuhoGO and tap "Receive"
2. Create an invoice for the expected amount (or just share your Spark address for any amount)
3. Send the QR code via WhatsApp, email, or any messenger
4. Your cousin scans it with their Bitcoin wallet and sends

**Why it works:** No international wire fees, no 3-5 business day waits. Money arrives in minutes regardless of which country either of you is in.


### Tipping a Content Creator

**The situation:** You enjoyed someone's podcast, video, or article and want to show appreciation.

**With BuhoGO:**
1. Find the creator's Lightning address (often in their bio or website)
2. Open BuhoGO, tap "Send"
3. Enter their address
4. Send any amount you like — even small tips work

**Why it works:** Lightning fees are tiny, so sending $0.50 actually makes sense. Creators get the full amount without platform cuts.


### Paying a Friend Back Instantly

**The situation:** Your friend spotted you for coffee. You want to pay them back right now.

**With BuhoGO (both using Spark):**
1. Ask for their Spark address (starts with `sp1...`)
2. Open BuhoGO, tap "Send"
3. Enter their address and the amount
4. Send — arrives instantly with **zero fees**

**Why it works:** Spark-to-Spark transfers cost nothing and confirm immediately. Perfect for settling up between friends.


### Building a Savings Habit

**The situation:** You want to stack sats (save Bitcoin) regularly without complicated exchanges.

**With BuhoGO:**
1. Create a Spark wallet (full control, your keys)
2. Share your Lightning address or invoice with services that pay in Bitcoin
3. Receive payments directly to your wallet
4. Watch your balance grow over time

**Why it works:** Self-custody means you own it completely. No exchange accounts, no withdrawal limits, no third parties.


## On-Chain Bitcoin (L1) Scenarios

### Withdrawing from an Exchange

**The situation:** You bought Bitcoin on an exchange and want to move it to your own wallet.

**With BuhoGO:**
1. Open BuhoGO and tap "Receive"
2. Switch to the "Bitcoin" tab
3. Copy your Bitcoin address (starts with `bc1p...`)
4. In your exchange, paste the address and confirm withdrawal
5. Wait for 3 confirmations (~30 minutes)
6. Tap "Claim" to add funds to your wallet

**Why it works:** Your Spark wallet has a real Bitcoin address. Once claimed, funds are immediately available for Lightning payments — no channel management needed.


### Moving to Cold Storage

**The situation:** You want to move some Bitcoin to a hardware wallet or cold storage for long-term saving.

**With BuhoGO:**
1. Get your hardware wallet's receive address
2. Open BuhoGO, tap "Send"
3. Scan or paste the Bitcoin address
4. Enter the amount and choose fee speed
5. Confirm the withdrawal

**Why it works:** Direct on-chain withdrawal to any Bitcoin address. Your hardware wallet receives real Bitcoin on the blockchain.


### Receiving a Large Payment

**The situation:** Someone wants to send you a significant amount of Bitcoin but doesn't have a Lightning wallet.

**With BuhoGO:**
1. Open BuhoGO, tap "Receive", switch to "Bitcoin" tab
2. Share your address or QR code
3. They send from any Bitcoin wallet or exchange
4. After 3 confirmations, claim the deposit
5. Funds are now ready for instant Lightning payments

**Why it works:** Bridges the gap between on-chain Bitcoin and Lightning. Receive from anywhere, spend instantly.


### Consolidating Bitcoin

**The situation:** You have Bitcoin in multiple places and want to consolidate into one wallet.

**With BuhoGO:**
1. Get your BuhoGO Bitcoin address (Receive → Bitcoin tab)
2. Send from each source to this address

4. All funds unified in one Lightning-enabled wallet

**Why it works:** One address, multiple deposits. Each becomes instantly spendable on Lightning once claimed.

1. Already have BuhoGO on your phone with some Bitcoin loaded
2. Scan the merchant's payment QR code
3. Pay in Bitcoin — no currency exchange needed

**Why it works:** Bitcoin works the same everywhere. No foreign transaction fees, no declined cards.


### Emergency Money Access

1. Your Bitcoin is accessible from any device with your seed phrase
2. Install BuhoGO, restore with your 12 words
3. Find a Bitcoin ATM or peer-to-peer exchange
4. Access your funds when banks can't help

**Why it works:** Self-custody means your money is truly yours. No bank hours, no customer service calls needed.

**The situation:** You want to support a cause without your bank seeing the transaction.

**With BuhoGO:**

**With BuhoGO:**
1. Find a merchant accepting Bitcoin
2. Pay with BuhoGO instead of card

**Why it works:** No credit card company tracking your purchases. No "you might also like" based on what you bought.


## Getting Started Scenarios

### "I'm New to Bitcoin"

**The situation:** You've heard about Bitcoin and want to try it without risking much.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Download BuhoGO
2. Create a Spark wallet (follow the backup steps carefully!)
3. Receive a small amount from a friend or buy a tiny amount
4. Try sending a payment to someone
5. Get comfortable before adding more funds

**Start small:** Your first transaction can be $1. Learn how it works before going bigger.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Download BuhoGO
2. Choose "Connect Wallet"
3. Get an NWC connection string from your existing wallet
4. Paste or scan it in BuhoGO
5. Use BuhoGO as your interface while your other wallet manages the funds

**Why:** You get BuhoGO's clean interface without moving your Bitcoin.


### "I Want Maximum Security"

**The situation:** You're serious about Bitcoin and want full control.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Create a Spark wallet in BuhoGO
2. Write down your 12-word seed phrase on paper
3. Store the paper in a secure location (safe, safety deposit box)
4. Consider a second copy in a different secure location
5. Use a strong, unique PIN

**Remember:** Your seed phrase = your Bitcoin. Lose the phrase, lose access. Keep it safe.
